Childhood living <br>
Is easy to do <br>
The things you wanted <br>
I bought them for you <br>
Graceless lady <br>
You know who I am <br>
You know I can't let you <br>
Slide through my hands <br>
Wild horses <br>
Couldn't drag me away <br>
Wild, wild horses <br>
Couldn't drag me away <br>
I watched you suffer <br>
A dull aching pain <br>
Now you've decided <br>
To show me the same <br>
No sweeping exit <br>
Or offstage lines <br>
Could make me feel bitter <br>
Or treat you unkind <br>
Wild horses <br>
Couldn't drag me away <br>
Wild, wild horses <br>
Couldn't drag me away <br>
I know I've dreamed you <br>
A sin and a lie <br>
I have my freedom <br>
But I don't have much time <br>
Faith has been broken <br>
Tears must be cried <br>
Let's do some living <br>
After we die <br>
Wild horses <br>
Couldn't drag me away <br>
Wild, wild horses <br>
We'll ride them some day <br>
Wild horses <br>
Couldn't drag me away <br>
Wild, wild horses <br>
We'll ride them some day <br>
